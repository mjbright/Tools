Tools
=====


This scripts are a fairly random collection of tools which hopefully may be useful to someone.

The intention is that they be in any scripting language whether it be Perl, Python, Bash, Ruby etc etc,
and whilst they generally assume a Unix/Linux platform they should all run under Cygwin on Windows also.

If I start adding Windows (non-Cygwin) specific scripts, in PowerShell for example, then I'll probably create
a separate project for that.

Enjoy.
